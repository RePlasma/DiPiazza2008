Abstract: _The Landau–Lifshitz (The Classical Theory of Fields. Elsevier, Oxford 1975) form of the Lorentz–Abraham–Dirac equation in the presence of a plane wave of arbitrary shape and polarization is solved exactly and in closed form. The explicit solution is presented in the particular, paradigmatic cases of a constant crossed field and of a monochromatic wave with circular and with linear polarization._

### Tricks:
- structure of PW (in particular, the orthogonality of the f_j^munu functions) leads to a finite number of Piccard iterations

### Exercises:
- prove eq 7
- prove higher order terms from Piccard series of eq 10 are identically zero
- prove eq 11
- prove eq 11 satisfies (u u) = 1
- prove eq 11 reduces to LL in the limit alpha->0
- confirm estimates of classical and quantum parameters before conclusions
  
### FAQ:
- Why do we need to decompose eq 3 into 2 terms if the $\psi$ s can already be arbitrary functions of phase $\phi$? The $\psi$ s are scalars. The two terms represent different polarization directions. This choice is general, and immediately includes LP and CP as particular cases.
- Why general function of phase if it's already a PW? PW means that the EM field is invariant in transverse coordinates. It can still have a temporal (longitudinal) envelope, and also more complicated structure, like a two-color laser (2 frequencies with some dephasing between them).
